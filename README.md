v1 5min CLI version

python3 index.py get/put email datatype data(if put only)

this is currently what we have.

how would we do this with sign in or create account?

basically do we need to add a separate command to create acct/login?

we could just use this format, check if there's an email associated, if so then continue.

else they would have to create account -> password/confirm password -> verify email w cognito. we tell them to try again after this.
